# QR and Short Link generator backend (QRL)

## Requirements
- MongoDB (Version 3.1.0 or higher, lower versions may work but are untested)

## How to run
### Shell
To run QRL on your terminal, ensure Rust is installed and then use the command below:
```Bash
  cargo run
```

### Docker
To run QRL in docker, use the Dockerfile included in the repo.
```Bash
  docker compose up -d
```

MongoDB is not included in the image above. 
To use this with a separate MongoDB image, you can use the following template file.
```YAML
services:
  backend:
    image: qrl-alpine:latest
    ports:
      - "9191:9191"
  
  database:
    image: mongodb:latest
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
```
